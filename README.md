# Q1) Write a simple Hello World program and its development process

# Theory
The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory. A program written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer can run. Many versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized as part of the Portable Operating System Interface.

# C- Programming Basics - Lab 2 (23/08/23)

# Q1) Write  a program to print sizes of different data types

# Theory
The sizeof(variable) operator computes the size of a variable. And, to print the result returned by sizeof , we use either %lu or %zu format specifier.
The data is classified into four categories:
Nominal data.
Ordinal data.
Discrete data.
Continuous data.
