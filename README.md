# Q1) Write a simple Hello World program and its development process

# Theory
The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory. A program written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer can run. Many versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized as part of the Portable Operating System Interface.

# Q1) Write  a program to print sizes of different data types

# Theory
The sizeof(variable) operator computes the size of a variable. And, to print the result returned by sizeof , we use either %lu or %zu format specifier.
The data is classified into four categories:
Nominal data.
Ordinal data.
Discrete data.
Continuous data.

# Q2) Write a C program to read a number from the user and print a table of multiplication for that number.

# Explanation:
To print multiplication table we need to iterate from 1 to 10. Run a loop from 1 to 10 , increment 1 on each iteration. The loop structure should look like for(i=1; i<=10; i++) . Inside loop generate multiplication table using num * i and print in specified format.

# Q3) Write a program to display different start patterns on screen.

# Explanation:
A Pattern is defined as a design that repeats a specific number of times. That pattern can be decorative in real life, like, for example, a rangoli. A pattern program in C helps improve the concept of looping and algorithms. They are easily displayed with the help of nested loops.

# Q1) Write a program to demonstrate pointers. Declare a pointer ptr to integer and equate it to the address of integer i. Print value of i, value of &i, value of ptr and value of *ptr.

# Theory:
Pointers are one of the most important and powerful features of the C programming language. They allow us to manipulate memory directly, which can be very useful in many programming scenarios. In C, a pointer is simply a variable that holds a memory address

# Q2)  Write a program in C to demonstrate function call by value and call by reference by writing a swap function to swap two integers.

# Theory:
In the case of Call by Value, when we pass the value of the parameter during the calling of the function, it copies them to the function's actual local argument. In the case of Call by Reference, when we pass the parameter's location reference/address, it copies and assigns them to the function's local argument.
